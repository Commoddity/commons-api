It also contains transitional provisions. Finally, Division 18 makes consequential amendments to other Acts.

(f) authorizing the provision of up-front emergency funding out of the Fund to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans for significant oil pollution incidents;

Division of corporation under foreign laws
(1.‍5) If a non-resident corporation (in this subsection referred to as the “original corporation”) governed by the laws of a foreign jurisdiction undergoes a division under those laws that results in all or part of its property and liabilities becoming the property and liabilities of one or more other non-resident corporations (each of which is referred to in this subsection as a “new corporation”) and, as a consequence of the division, a shareholder of the original corporation acquires one or more shares (referred to in this subsection as “new shares”) of the capital stock of a new corporation at a particular time, the following rules apply:
(a) except to the extent that any of subparagraphs (1)‍(a.‍1)‍(i) to (iii) and paragraph (1)‍(b) applies (determined without reference to this subsection) to the acquisition of the new shares
(i) in the case where, for each class of shares of the capital stock of the original corporation of which shares are held by the shareholder immediately before the division, new shares are received at the particular time by shareholders of that class on a pro rata basis in respect of all the shares (referred to in this subsection as the “original shares”) of that class
(A) at the particular time, the original corporation is deemed to have distributed, and the shareholder is deemed to have received, as a dividend in kind in respect of the original shares, the new shares acquired by the shareholder at the particular time, and
(B) the amount of the dividend in kind received by the shareholder in respect of an original share is deemed to be equal to the fair market value, immediately after the particular time, of the new shares acquired by the shareholder at the particular time in respect of the original share, and
(ii) in any case where subparagraph (i) does not apply, the original corporation is deemed, at the particular time, to have conferred a benefit on the shareholder equal to the total fair market value, at that time, of the new shares acquired by the shareholder as a consequence of the division;
(b) any gain or loss of the original corporation from a distribution of the new shares as a consequence of the division is deemed to be nil; and
(c) each property of the original corporation that becomes at any time (referred to in this paragraph as the “disposition time”) property of the new corporation as a consequence of the division is deemed to be
(i) disposed of by the original corporation immediately before the disposition time for proceeds of disposition equal to the property’s fair market value, and
(ii) acquired by the new corporation at the disposition time at a cost equal to the amount determined under subparagraph (i) to be the original corporation’s proceeds of disposition.
(3) Subsection (1) is deemed to have come into force on October 24, 2012.
(4) Subsection (2) applies in respect of divisions that occur after October 23, 2012.

(2) Subsection (1) applies in respect of transactions or events that occur after February 26, 2018.
4 (1) Paragraph (k) of the definition proceeds of disposition in section 54 of the Act is replaced by the following:
(k) any amount that would otherwise be proceeds of disposition of property of a taxpayer to the extent that the amount is deemed by subsection 84.‍1(1), 212.‍1(1.‍1) or 212.‍2(2) to be a dividend paid to the taxpayer or, if the taxpayer is a partnership, to a member of the taxpayer; (produit de disposition)
(2) Subsection (1) applies in respect of dispositions that occur after February 26, 2018.
5 (1) Paragraphs 84(1)‍(c.‍1) and (c.‍2) of the Act are replaced by the following:

(c.‍2) if the corporation is a bank, any action by which it converts any of its contributed surplus that arose on the issuance of shares of its capital stock (other than any portion of that contributed surplus that arose at a time when it was non-resident, or that arose in connection with a disposition to which subsection 212.‍1(1.‍1) applies or an investment, as defined in subsection 212.‍3(10), to which subsection 212.‍3(2) applies) into paid-up capital in respect of shares of its capital stock, or

(5) Section 95 of the Act is amended by adding the following after subsection (7):
Tracking interests — interpretation
(8) For the purposes of subsections (9) to (12), a particular property is a tracking interest in respect of a person or partnership (referred to in this subsection as the “tracked entity”) if
(a) all or part of the fair market value of the particular property — or of any payment or right to receive an amount in respect of the particular property — can reasonably be considered to be determined, directly or indirectly, by reference to one or more of the following criteria in respect of property or activities of the tracked entity (referred to in this subsection and subsections (9) to (11) as the “tracked property and activities”):
(i) the fair market value of property of the tracked entity,
(ii) any revenue, income or cash flow from property or activities of the tracked entity,
(iii) any profits or gains from the disposition of property of the tracked entity, and
(iv) any similar criteria in respect of property or activities of the tracked entity; and
(b) the tracked property and activities in respect of the particular property represent less than all of the property and activities of the tracked entity.
Tracking interests — investment business definition
(9) For the purposes of the definition investment business in subsection (1), if, at any time in a taxation year of a foreign affiliate of a taxpayer, a person or partnership holds a tracking interest in respect of the affiliate or a partnership of which the affiliate is a member, the tracked property and activities in respect of the tracking interest are, to the extent they would not otherwise be part of an investment business of the affiliate, deemed, in respect of the taxpayer,
(a) to be a separate business carried on by the affiliate throughout the year; and
(b) not to be part of any other business of the affiliate.
Conditions for subsection (11)
(10) Subsection (11) applies in respect of a foreign affiliate of a taxpayer for a taxation year of the affiliate if, at any time in the year,
(a) the taxpayer holds a property that is a tracking interest in respect of the affiliate; and
(b) shares of a class of the capital stock of the affiliate the fair market value of which can reasonably be considered to be determined by reference to the tracked property and activities in respect of the tracking interest (referred to in subsection (11) as a “tracking class”) are held by the taxpayer or a foreign affiliate of the taxpayer.
Tracking class — separate corporation
(11) If this subsection applies in respect of a foreign affiliate (referred to in this subsection as the “actual affiliate”) of a taxpayer for a taxation year of the actual affiliate, the following rules apply for the purpose of determining the amounts, if any, to be included under subsection 91(1), and to be deducted under subsection 91(4), by the taxpayer in respect of the year and for the purpose of applying section 233.‍4 in respect of the year:
(a) the tracked property and activities of the actual affiliate are deemed to be property and activities of a non-resident corporation (referred to in this subsection as the “separate corporation”) that is separate from the actual affiliate and not to be property or activities of the actual affiliate;
(b) any income, losses or gains for the year in respect of the property and activities described in paragraph (a) are deemed to be income, losses or gains of the separate corporation and not of the actual affiliate;
(c) all rights and obligations of the actual affiliate in respect of the property and activities described in paragraph (a) are deemed to be rights and obligations of the separate corporation and not of the actual affiliate;
(d) the separate corporation is deemed to have, at the end of the year, 100 issued and outstanding shares of a single class (referred to in this subsection as the “single class”) of its capital stock, having full voting rights under all circumstances;
(e) each shareholder of the actual affiliate is deemed to own, at the end of the year, that number of shares of the single class that is equal to the product of 100 and the amount that would be the aggregate participating percentage (as defined in subsection 91(1.‍3)) of that shareholder in respect of the actual affiliate for the year if
(i) the actual affiliate were a controlled foreign affiliate of that shareholder at the end of the year,
(ii) the only shares of the capital stock of the actual affiliate issued and outstanding at the end of the year were shares of tracking classes in respect of the tracked properties and activities, and
(iii) the only income, losses and gains of the actual affiliate for the year were those referred to in paragraph (b); and
(f) any amounts included under subsection 91(1), or deducted under subsection 91(4), by the taxpayer in respect of shares of the separate corporation are deemed to be amounts included under subsection 91(1), or deducted under subsection 91(4), as the case may be, by the taxpayer in respect of shares of tracking classes held by the taxpayer or a foreign affiliate of the taxpayer, as the case may be.
Tracking interests – controlled foreign affiliate
(12) If subsection (11) does not apply in respect of a foreign affiliate of the taxpayer for a taxation year of the affiliate, the affiliate is deemed to be a controlled foreign affiliate of the taxpayer throughout the taxation year if, at any time in the year, a tracking interest in respect of the affiliate, or a partnership of which the affiliate is a member, is held by
(a) the taxpayer; or
(b) a person or partnership (each referred to in this paragraph as a “holder”), if
(i) the holder does not deal at arm’s length with the taxpayer at that time,
(ii) where either the taxpayer or the holder is a partnership and the other party is not, any member of the partnership does not deal at arm’s length, at that time, with the other party, or
(iii) where both the taxpayer and the holder are partnerships, the taxpayer or any member of the taxpayer does not deal at arm’s length, at that time, with the holder or any member of the holder.
(6) Subsections (1) to (4) apply to taxation years of a foreign affiliate of a taxpayer that begin after February 26, 2018.
(7) Subsection (5) applies to taxation years of a foreign affiliate of a taxpayer that begin after February 26, 2018, except that, notwithstanding subsection 95(10) of the Act, as enacted by subsection (5), subsection 95(11) of the Act, as enacted by subsection (5), shall not apply in respect of a foreign affiliate of the taxpayer in respect of taxation years of the affiliate that begin after February 26, 2018 and before October 25, 2018, if the taxpayer
(a) elects in writing under this subsection in respect of all of its foreign affiliates; and
(b) files the election with the Minister of National Revenue on or before the day that is the later of
(i) the day that is six months after the day on which this Act receives royal assent, and
(ii) the taxpayer’s filing-due date for its taxation year that includes October 25, 2018.

Tiered partnerships
(2.‍01) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a partnership.
(2) Subsection 96(2.‍1) of the Act is amended by striking out “and” at the end of paragraph (d) and by replacing paragraph (e) with the following:

(f) if the taxpayer is a partnership, reduce the taxpayer’s share of any loss of the partnership for a fiscal period of the partnership ending in the taxation year of the taxpayer from a business (other than a farming business) or from property.
(3) Section 96 of the Act is amended by adding the following after subsection (2.‍1):
Tiered partnerships — adjustments
(2.‍11) The following rules apply to taxation years of a taxpayer that end after February 26, 2018:

(b) in computing the adjusted cost base to the taxpayer of the taxpayer’s interest in a partnership after February 26, 2018, there shall be added an amount equal to the portion of the amount of any reduction because of paragraph (a) in a non-capital loss of the taxpayer that can reasonably be considered to relate to the amount of a loss deducted under subparagraph 53(2)‍(c)‍(i) in computing the adjusted cost base of that interest.
(4) Subsections (1) and (2) apply to taxation years that end after February 26, 2018.
