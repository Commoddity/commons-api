(f) removing the risk score requirement and increasing the level of income that can be deducted for Canadian armed forces personnel and police officers serving on designated international missions;
(g) introducing the Canada Workers Benefit;
(h) expanding the medical expense tax credit to recognize expenses incurred in respect of an animal specially trained to perform tasks for a patient with a severe mental impairment;

(k) extending, by five years, the ability of a qualifying family member to be the plan holder of an individual’s Registered Disability Savings Plan;
(l) allowing transfers of property from charities to municipalities to be considered as qualifying expenditures for the purposes of reducing revocation tax;
(m) ensuring that appropriate taxpayers are eligible for the Canada Child Benefit and that information related to the Canada Child Benefit can be shared with provinces and territories for certain purposes; and
(n) extending, by five years, eligibility for Class 43.‍2.
Part 2 implements certain excise measures proposed in the February 27, 2018 budget by
(a) advancing the existing inflationary adjustments for excise duty rates on tobacco products to occur on an annual basis rather than every five years; and
(b) increasing excise duty rates on tobacco products to account for inflation since the last inflationary adjustment in 2014 and by an additional $1 per carton of 200 cigarettes, along with corresponding increases to the excise duty rates on other tobacco products.

(f) making related amendments to other legislative texts, including ensuring that any sales of cannabis products that would otherwise be considered as basic groceries are subject to the GST/HST in the same way as sales of other types of cannabis products.
Part 4 amends the Pension Act to authorize the Minister of Veterans Affairs to waive, in certain cases, the requirement for an application for an award under that Act.
It also amends the Veterans Well-being Act to, among other things,
(a) replace the earnings loss benefit, career impact allowance, supplementary retirement benefit and retirement income security benefit with the income replacement benefit;
(b) replace the disability award with pain and suffering compensation; and
(c) create additional pain and suffering compensation.
Finally, it makes consequential amendments to other Acts.
Part 5 enacts the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act and makes the Fuel Charge Regulations.
Part 1 of that Act sets out the regime for a charge on fossil fuels. The fuel charge regime provides that a charge applies, at rates set out in Schedule 2 to that Act, to fuels that are produced, delivered or used in a listed province, brought into a listed province from another place in Canada, or imported into Canada at a location in a listed province. The fuel charge regime also provides relief from the fuel charge, through rebate and exemption certificate mechanisms, in certain circumstances. The fuel charge regime also sets out the registration requirements for persons that carry out certain activities relating to fuels subject to the charge. Part 1 of that Act also contains administrative provisions and enforcement provisions, including penalties, offences and collection provisions. Part 1 of that Act also sets out a mechanism for distributing revenues from the fuel charge. Part 1 of that Act also provides the Governor in Council with authority to make regulations for purposes of that Part, including the authority to determine which province, territory or area is a listed province for purpose of that Part.
Part 2 of that Act sets out the regime for pricing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. The industrial emissions pricing regime requires the registration of any facility that is located in a province or area that is set out in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to that Act and that either meets criteria specified by regulation or voluntarily joins the regime. The industrial emissions pricing regime requires compliance reporting with respect to any facility that is covered by the regime and the provision of compensation for any amount of a greenhouse gas that the facility emits above the applicable emissions limit during a compliance period. Part 2 of that Act also sets out an information gathering regime, administrative powers, duties and functions, enforcement tools, offences and related penalties, and a mechanism for distributing revenues from the industrial emissions pricing regime. Part 2 of that Act also provides the Governor in Council with the authority to make regulations for the purposes of that Part and the authority to make orders that amend Part 2 of Schedule 1 by adding, deleting or amending the name of a province or the description of an area.
Part 3 of that Act authorizes the Governor in Council to make regulations that provide for the application of provincial laws concerning greenhouse gas emissions to works, undertakings, lands and waters under federal jurisdiction.
Part 4 of that Act requires the Minister of the Environment to prepare an annual report on the administration of the Act and to cause it to be tabled in each House of Parliament.
Part 6 amends several Acts in order to implement various measures.
Division 1 of Part 6 amends the Financial Administration Act to establish the office of the Chief Information Officer of Canada and to provide that the President of the Treasury Board is responsible for the coordination of that Officer’s activities with those of the other deputy heads of the Treasury Board Secretariat. It also amends the Act to ensure Crown corporations with no borrowing authority are able to continue to enter into leases and to specify that leases are not considered to be transactions to borrow money for the purposes of Crown corporations’ statutory borrowing limits.
Division 2 of Part 6 amends the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act in order to modernize and enhance the Canadian deposit insurance framework to ensure it continues to meet its objectives, including financial stability.

Division 6 of Part 6 amends the Bank of Canada Act to require the Bank of Canada to make adequate arrangements for the removal from circulation in Canada of its bank notes that are worn or mutilated or that are the subject of an order made under paragraph 9(1)‍(b) of the Currency Act. It also amends the Currency Act to provide, among other things, that
(a) bank notes are current if they are issued under the authority of the Bank of Canada Act;
(b) the Governor in Council may, by order, call in certain bank notes; and
(c) bank notes that are called in by order are not current.

Division 8 of Part 6 amends the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act to, among other things,
(a) create the position of Vice-chairperson of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal;
(b) provide that former permanent members of the Tribunal may be re-appointed to one further term as a permanent member; and
(c) clarify the rules concerning the interim replacement of the Chairperson of the Tribunal and provide for the interim replacement of the Vice-chairperson of the Tribunal.

It also provides that the Order entitled Game Declared in Danger of Becoming Extinct is deemed to have continued in force and to have continued to apply in Nunavut, as of April 1, 2014.

Division 11 of Part 6 amends the Red Tape Reduction Act to permit an administrative burden imposed by regulations to be offset by the reduction of another administrative burden imposed by another jurisdiction if the reduction is the result of regulatory cooperation agreements.
Division 12 of Part 6 provides for the transfer of certain employees and disclosure of information to the Communications Security Establishment to improve cyber security.

This division also makes consequential amendments to the Federal Courts Act.

PART 5 
Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act
Enactment of Act
Enactment
186 The Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, whose text is as follows and whose Schedules 1 to 4 are set out in Schedule 4 to this Act, is enacted:
An Act to mitigate climate change through the pan-Canadian application of pricing mechanisms to a broad set of greenhouse gas emission sources and to make consequential amendments to other Acts
Preamble
Whereas there is broad scientific consensus that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global climate change;
Whereas recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are at the highest level in history and present an unprecedented risk to the environment, including its biological diversity, to human health and safety and to economic prosperity;
Whereas impacts of climate change, such as coastal erosion, thawing permafrost, increases in heat waves, droughts and flooding, and related risks to critical infrastructures and food security are already being felt throughout Canada and are impacting Canadians, in particular the Indigenous peoples of Canada, low-income citizens and northern, coastal and remote communities;
Whereas Parliament recognizes that it is the responsibility of the present generation to minimize impacts of climate change on future generations;
Whereas the United Nations, Parliament and the scientific community have identified climate change as an international concern which cannot be contained within geographic boundaries;
Whereas Canada has ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, done in New York on May 9, 1992, which entered into force in 1994, and the objective of that Convention is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system;
Whereas Canada has also ratified the Paris Agreement, done in Paris on December 12, 2015, which entered into force in 2016, and the aims of that Agreement include holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.‍5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;
Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to achieving Canada’s Nationally Determined Contribution – and increasing it over time – under the Paris Agreement by taking comprehensive action to reduce emissions across all sectors of the economy, accelerate clean economic growth and build resilience to the impacts of climate change;
Whereas it is recognized in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change that climate change is a national problem that requires immediate action by all governments in Canada as well as by industry, non-governmental organizations and individual Canadians;
Whereas greenhouse gas emissions pricing is a core element of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change;
Whereas behavioural change that leads to increased energy efficiency, to the use of cleaner energy, to the adoption of cleaner technologies and practices and to innovation is necessary for effective action against climate change;
Whereas the pricing of greenhouse gas emissions on a basis that increases over time is an appropriate and efficient way to create incentives for that behavioural change;
Whereas greenhouse gas emissions pricing reflects the “polluter pays” principle;
Whereas some provinces are developing or have implemented greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems;
Whereas the absence of greenhouse gas emissions pricing in some provinces and a lack of stringency in some provincial greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems could contribute to significant deleterious effects on the environment, including its biological diversity, on human health and safety and on economic prosperity;
And whereas it is necessary to create a federal greenhouse gas emissions pricing scheme to ensure that, taking provincial greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems into account, greenhouse gas emissions pricing applies broadly in Canada;
Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

Registration in court
(2) On production to the Federal Court, a certificate made under subsection (1) in respect of a debtor must be registered in the Court and when so registered has the same effect, and all proceedings may be taken on the certificate, as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court against the debtor for a debt in the amount certified plus interest on the amount as provided under this Part to the day of payment and, for the purposes of those proceedings, the certificate is deemed to be a judgment of the Court against the debtor for a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada and enforceable as such.
Costs

(4) A document issued by the Federal Court evidencing a registered certificate in respect of a debtor, a writ of that Court issued pursuant to the certificate or any notification of the document or writ (which document, writ or notification is in this section referred to as a “memorial”) may be filed, registered or otherwise recorded for the purpose of creating a charge, lien or priority on, or a binding interest in property in a province, or any interest in, or for civil law any right in, such property, held by the debtor, in the same manner as a document evidencing
(a) a judgment of the superior court of the province against a person for a debt owing by the person, or
(b) an amount payable or required to be remitted by a person in the province in respect of a debt owing to Her Majesty in right of the province
may be filed, registered or otherwise recorded in accordance with the law of the province to create a charge, lien or priority on, or a binding interest in, the property or interest.
Creation of charge
(5) If a memorial has been filed, registered or otherwise recorded under subsection (4),
(a) a charge, lien or priority is created on, or a binding interest is created in, property in the province, or any interest in, or for civil law any right in, such property, held by the debtor, or
(b) such property, or interest or right in the property, is otherwise bound,
in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)‍(a) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)‍(b), and the charge, lien, priority or binding interest created is subordinate to any charge, lien, priority or binding interest in respect of which all steps necessary to make it effective against other creditors were taken before the time the memorial was filed, registered or otherwise recorded.
Proceedings in respect of memorial
(6) If a memorial is filed, registered or otherwise recorded in a province under subsection (4), proceedings may be taken in the province in respect of the memorial, including proceedings
(a) to enforce payment of the amount evidenced by the memorial, interest on the amount and all costs and charges paid or incurred in respect of

in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)‍(a) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)‍(b), except that, if in any such proceeding or as a condition precedent to any such proceeding, any order, consent or ruling is required under the law of the province to be made or given by the superior court of the province or by a judge or official of the court, a like order, consent or ruling may be made or given by the Federal Court or by a judge or official of the Federal Court and, when so made or given, has the same effect for the purposes of the proceeding as if it were made or given by the superior court of the province or by a judge or official of the court.
Presentation of documents
(7) If
(a) a memorial is presented for filing, registration or other recording under subsection (4), or a document relating to the memorial is presented for filing, registration or other recording for the purpose of any proceeding described in subsection (6), to any official in the land registry system, personal property or movable property registry system, or other registry system, of a province, or
(b) access is sought to any person, place or thing in a province to make the filing, registration or other recording,
the memorial or document must be accepted for filing, registration or other recording or the access must be granted, as the case may be, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial or document relating to the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)‍(a) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)‍(b) for the purpose of a like proceeding, except that, if the memorial or document is issued by the Federal Court or signed or certified by a judge or official of the Court, any affidavit, declaration or other evidence required under the law of the province to be provided with or to accompany the memorial or document in the proceedings is deemed to have been provided with or to have accompanied the memorial or document as so required.
Prohibition — sale, etc.‍, without consent
(8) Despite any law of Canada or of a province, a sheriff or other person must not, without the written consent of the Minister, sell or otherwise dispose of any property or publish any notice or otherwise advertise in respect of any sale or other disposition of any property pursuant to any process issued or charge, lien, priority or binding interest created in any proceeding to collect an amount certified in a certificate made under subsection (1), interest on the amount or costs. However, if that consent is subsequently given, any property that would have been affected by that process, charge, lien, priority or binding interest if the Minister’s consent had been given at the time that process was issued or the charge, lien, priority or binding interest was created, as the case may be, is bound, seized, attached, charged or otherwise affected as it would be if that consent had been given at the time that process was issued or the charge, lien, priority or binding interest was created, as the case may be.
Completion of notices, etc.
(9) If information required to be set out by any sheriff or other person in a minute, notice or document required to be completed for any purpose cannot, because of subsection (8), be so set out without the written consent of the Minister, the sheriff or other person must complete the minute, notice or document to the extent possible without that information and, when that consent of the Minister is given, a further minute, notice or document setting out all the information must be completed for the same purpose, and the sheriff or other person, having complied with this subsection, is deemed to have complied with this Part, regulation or rule requiring the information to be set out in the minute, notice or document.
Application for order
(10) A sheriff or other person that is unable, because of subsection (8) or (9), to comply with any law or rule of court is bound by any order made by a judge of the Federal Court, on an ex parte application by the Minister, for the purpose of giving effect to the proceeding, charge, lien, priority or binding interest.
Secured claims
(11) If a charge, lien, priority or binding interest created under subsection (5) by filing, registering or otherwise recording a memorial under subsection (4) is registered in accordance with subsection 87(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, it is deemed
(a) to be a claim that is secured by a security and that, subject to subsection 87(2) of that Act, ranks as a secured claim under that Act; and
(b) to also be a claim referred to in paragraph 86(2)‍(a) of that Act.
Details in certificates and memorials
(12) Despite any law of Canada or of a province, in any certificate in respect of a debtor, any memorial evidencing a certificate or any writ or document issued for the purpose of collecting an amount certified, it is sufficient for all purposes
(a) to set out, as the amount payable by the debtor, the total of amounts payable by the debtor without setting out the separate amounts making up that total; and
(b) to refer to the rate of interest or penalty to be charged on the separate amounts making up the amount payable in general terms
(i) in the case of interest, as interest at the prescribed rate under this Part applicable from time to time on amounts payable to the Receiver General, without indicating the specific rates of interest to be charged on each of the separate amounts or to be charged for any period; and

(b) a person, other than an institution, will loan or advance money to, or make a payment on behalf of, a debtor that the Minister knows or suspects

Effect of receipt
(3) A receipt issued by the Minister for money paid as required under this section is a good and sufficient discharge of the original liability to the extent of the payment.
Effect of requirement
(4) If the Minister has, under this section, required a person to pay to the Receiver General on account of the liability under this Part of a debtor money otherwise payable by the person to the debtor as interest, rent, remuneration, a dividend, an annuity or other periodic payment, the requirement applies to all such payments to be made by the person to the debtor until the liability under this Part is satisfied and operates to require payments to the Receiver General out of each such payment of any amount that is stipulated by the Minister in a notice in writing.

(f) subsection 73(2) and sections 97, 123, 129 and 130 apply as if the net charge for the assessed period were not required to be paid, and the return for that period were not required to be filed, until the last day of the period described in subsection (9).

Sentencing

(a) the deterrence of the offender and any other person from committing offences under this Part;
(b) the denunciation of the unlawful conduct; and
(c) the reinforcement of the “polluter pays” principle.
Principles
248 (1) In addition to the principles and factors that the court is otherwise required to consider, including those set out in sections 718.‍1 to 718.‍21 of the Criminal Code, the court must consider the following principles when sentencing a person that is convicted of an offence under this Part:
(a) the amount of the fine should be increased to account for every aggravating factor associated with the offence, including the aggravating factors set out in subsection (2); and

Aggravating factors
(2) The aggravating factors are the following:
(a) the offender committed the offence intentionally or recklessly;
(b) the offender failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the offence despite having the financial means to do so;

(d) the offender committed the offence despite having been warned by an enforcement officer of the circumstances that subsequently became the subject of the offence;
(e) the offender has a history of non-compliance with federal or provincial legislation that relates to the control or pricing of greenhouse gas emissions; and

(i) attempted to conceal its commission,
(ii) failed to take prompt action to prevent, mitigate or remediate its effects, or
(iii) failed to take prompt action to reduce the risk of committing similar offences in the future.
Absence of aggravating factor
(3) The absence of an aggravating factor set out in subsection (2) is not a mitigating factor.
Reasons
(4) If the court is satisfied of the existence of one or more of the aggravating factors set out in subsection (2) but decides not to increase the amount of the fine because of that factor, the court must give reasons for that decision.
Orders of court
249 (1) If an offender has been convicted of an offence under this Part, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed under this Part, the court may, having regard to the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, make an order having any or all of the following effects:
